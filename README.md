# DataStructures-Python

- Binary Search Tree
  - Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers. It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a 
    maximum of two children. It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.

- Linked List
  - A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. 
    A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

- Queue
  - Queue is also an abstract data type or a linear data structure, just like stack data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called the 
    REAR(also called tail), and the removal of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head).
    
- Stack
  - A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion 
    and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.
  
- General Tree
  - A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, 
    together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
